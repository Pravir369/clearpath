# ClearPath — Claude Code Master Context
# READ THIS ENTIRE FILE BEFORE DOING ANYTHING.
# This file is your complete instructions for every session.

---

## CURRENT TASK
**Stage 1 — Task F-7**
Set up .gitignore and commit to GitHub.

---

## YOUR RULES — ALWAYS FOLLOW THESE
1. Complete ONLY the current task listed in CURRENT TASK above
2. Do NOT modify files outside the scope of the current task
3. Do NOT add features not mentioned in the current task
4. After completing the task, tell me: (a) what files you changed, (b) the exact command to verify it works
5. If you hit an error you cannot resolve in 2 attempts, STOP and explain what is blocking you
6. Never proceed to the next task without explicit instruction from me
7. Never add behavioral assessment fields (risk_score, prediction, behavior, location, danger) to any database model — ever

---

## PROJECT SUMMARY
ClearPath is an AI-powered dashboard for parole officers — not for formerly incarcerated people. It automatically maps which benefit programs each client qualifies for, tracks 30-day application windows, flags the ID/address catch-22, and uses Groq AI to generate action items and intake summaries for weekly meetings. It NEVER scores, predicts, or surveils clients — it only tracks what the SYSTEM owes the client.

---

## TECH STACK
- Backend: Python 3.11 + FastAPI
- Database: SQLite + SQLAlchemy + Alembic
- AI: Groq API — llama-3.3-70b-versatile (OpenAI-compatible SDK)
- Frontend: React 18 + Vite + Tailwind CSS + React Router v6
- Auth: Google OAuth + JWT — Stage 8 ONLY, not yet

## DATABASE SCHEMA
### Table: officers
- id: String (UUID, primary key)
- email: String (unique)
- name: String
- google_id: String (nullable — populated in Stage 8)
- created_at: DateTime

### Table: clients
- id: String (UUID, primary key)
- officer_id: String (FK → officers.id)
- name: String
- release_date: Date
- county: String (e.g. "Fulton County, GA")
- conviction_type: String ("non-violent drug" / "violent" / "property" / "other")
- age: Integer
- is_veteran: Boolean (default False)
- has_dependents: Boolean (default False)
- created_at: DateTime
- ⛔ NO risk_score, behavior, location, prediction, or any behavioral field — EVER

---

## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (.env)
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key_here
GROQ_MODEL=llama-3.3-70b-versatile
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./clearpath.db
JWT_SECRET=your_random_secret
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

---

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS — NEVER VIOLATE
1. ⛔ DB schema: NO behavioral fields (risk_score, prediction, behavior, location, danger)
2. ⛔ Groq prompt: NEVER ask model to assess risk or predict behavior
3. ⛔ Routes: Use officer_id="demo-officer-1" hardcoded until Stage 8
4. ⛔ Prompts: Live in backend/prompts/ as .txt files — never hardcode in Python
5. ⛔ Pages: All pages except Login.jsx must use Layout.jsx wrapper
6. ⛔ Auth: Do NOT implement any auth until Stage 8

---

## DEMO SCRIPT (what the app must do)
1. Officer sees dashboard with 5 clients sorted red → yellow → green
2. Clicks Marcus Johnson (released 8 days ago, RED urgency)
3. Client detail shows:
   - Orange catch-22 banner with Fulton County DFCS address
   - 3 AI-generated action items for this week
   - Benefits panel: SNAP red, Medicaid yellow, WIOA green
   - 2-sentence AI intake summary
4. Officer adds new client → analysis generates in under 10 seconds
